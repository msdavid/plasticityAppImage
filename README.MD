## Plasticity AppImage

This is a simple script to build an AppImage pacakge for Plasticity. ( https://www.plasticity.xyz/ )
Unfortunately Plasticity only releases deb packages for debian-like distributions and I am a nixOS user.
I made this simple script so I could run plasticity in my machine and creating this repo in case anyone else can benefit.  

#### If you just want to run the app
download the AppImage and run it in your machine (in nixOS you need appimage-run)  

#### If you would like to build the AppImage yoursef
Use the build script
I used distrobox ( https://github.com/89luca89/distrobox ) to build in a Debian 12 image
Once you are into your distr0 clon this repo, make changes to the build.sh script if needed and run it.
